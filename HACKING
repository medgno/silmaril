Any patches are welcome. Email them to david@davidschroeder.net. If there's enough interest in this project, I'll get a mailing list set up.

Conventions used in this project:
* Opening braces are *NOT* on their own line
* Indentation is with tabs, and I tend to display them as 4-spaces
* Classes are CamelCased
* Variables are the other form of camelCased
* File names are the class name (with capitalization), or the name of what's in the file (e.g. DumbContainer vs pfm)
* Extensions are .cpp and .h
